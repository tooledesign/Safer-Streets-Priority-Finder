# Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder

The Safer Streets Priority Finder enables you to analyze the risk to bicyclists and pedestrians on your communityâ€™s roads. You can use your local road, crash, and study area data or select from nationally available datasets to:

1. Explore descriptive statistics related to your crash data
2. Develop a Sliding Windows Analysis using historical crash data to inform a High Injury Network
3. Develop a Safer Streets Model to estimate risk along your road network, even in areas that haven't had any reported crashes recently

## How to launch the SSPF, what you'll need

1. **Linux** - You'll need sudo access on a Linux command line. 
2. **A PostgreSQL Relational Database** - Access to a PostgreSQL database that follows the schema and table structure provided [here](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/build_psql_db.sql).
3. **Static tables** - Upload the following table into the 'static' schema on the PostgreSQL datatable. 
  1. [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) 2015 - 2019](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/) - as, static.national_fclass_priors
  2. [USDOT-OST / Pedestrian-Fatality-Risk-Project](https://github.com/USDOT-OST/Pedestrian-Fatality-Risk-Project) - as, static.fars_processed
  3. [US Census Counties](https://www.census.gov/data.html) - as, static.us_county_2018
  4. [National Open Street Map Roads Dataset, Available from GeoFabrik](https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) - as, static.osm_centerlines
  5. [Functional Classification Priors](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/national_fclass_priors.csv) - as, static.osm_centerlines
      
      Datasets 1-4 need a state and county [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips#:~:text=FIPS%20are%20standards%20and%20guidelines,by%20the%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce) code, where the state FIPS code is always two digits in length, and county codes are three digits, including leading zeros as needed. FIPS codes on each dataset should be stored in TEXT or VARCHAR format.
      
      See [this file](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/build_psql_db.sql) for more infomration on the data structure for each table listed above. 
      
4. **Complete system variables** - Fill out your system variables, so the Docker container can link the user information with the data. You'll need to do this [here](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/safer_streets_priority_finder/env_variables.R) and [here](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/vulusr_model_processor/env_variables.R). Do not relocate this file. 
5. **Docker** - If you don't already have Docker installed on your machine, you can get started [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


## How to launch the application

The easiest way to launch the application is setup a PostgreSQL database following the structure provided above. Once that's ready, launch a Docker container with the model processor, and a seperate container with the SSPF Tool.

### Step 1. Clone the Safer Streets Priority Finder repository 

``` sudo up ```

``` git clone https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder.git ```

### Step 2. Update system variables 

Navigate to the first file where system variables are required: 

``` cd Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/safer_streets_priority_finder/ ```

You can update the system variables on the CL with ```nano``` text editor.

``` nano env_variables.R ```

Update all variables in that file. Here's a breakdown of what each variable refers to: 

1. **SSPF_EMAIL_PASSWORD** - password to an email account that sends a notification to users that a model has started or finished.
2. **SSPF_EMAIL_ADDRESS** - email address to send notification 
3. **SSPF_AMAZON_HOST_ADDRESS***  - host address to PostgreSQL Relational Database 
4. **SSPF_AMAZON_PASSWORD** - password to PostgreSQL Relational Database
5. **SSPF_AMAZON_USERNAME** - username for PostgreSQL Relational Database
6. **SSPF_AMAZON_DATABASE** - the name of the database with schema structure for the tool 

Now do the same for the model processor. 

``` cd .. ``` 

``` cd Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/vulusr_model_processor/ ```

``` nano env_variables.R ```

### Step 3. Docker setup

First, make sure you're logged into your Docker account. 

``` docker login ```

If you haven't already done so, you'll need a network to link systems together. 

``` docker network create sp-example-net ```

### Step 4. Launch model processor 

From the ```Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/vulusr_model_processor/``` directory, build a local image from the ```Dockerfile```. 

Then build the model processor image with the following: 

```docker build -t sspf_model_processor .```

This will build an image called ```sspf_model_processor```. 

After that's complete, you launch a container with, 

```docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net sp-example-net --name=ssfp --restart=always -p 9001:3839 sspf_model_processor``` 

At this time, your model processor is running in a detached Docker container listening for a user to request a model. The model will port everything to the PostgreSQL database identified in the env_variables.R file. 

To stop the container, use the command, ```docker stop ssfp```. 

Prune off unwanted containers with, ```docker container prune ssfp ```. 

### Step 4. Locally launch the Safer Streets Priority Finder

Navigate to the safer-streets-priority-finder directory. This directory should container a Dockerfile. 

``` cd Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/safer_streets_priority_finder/ ```

Then build the Safer Streets Priority Finder with the following: 

```docker build -t sspf .```

```docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net sp-example-net --name=ssfp --restart=always -p 9000:3838 sspf``` 

Now navigate to http://localhost:9001/, and you should see the Safer Streets Priority Finder. 

## Final notes

If you want to run the UI from your local RStudio environment, [here's a list](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/safer_streets_priority_finder/required_libraries.R) of libraries that you'll need. Open [this project](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/safer_streets_priority_finder/safer_streets_priority_finder.Rproj) within RStudio. Then open and run [this file](https://github.com/tooledesign/Safer-Streets-Priority-Finder/blob/main/safer_streets_priority_finder/dev/run_dev.R) and that should launch the UI on your local computer. 

If you have any questions you can reach out to the developers by emailing, saferstreetspriorityfinder@tooledesign.com.
